# Project_Finger_Water
The following final project thesis is the set of applications for an audio recognition and second screen system via digital audio fingerprinting and watermarking techniques.The work is based on the papers of  Avery Li-chun Wang; "An Industrial-Strength Audio Search Algorithm" ,2003 and Ingemar J. Cox, Senior Member, IEEE, Joe Kilian, F. Thomson Leighton, and Talal Shamoon, Member, IEEE ;Secure Spread Spectrum Watermarking for Multimedia,1997.

Code implementation is based on the following sites: https://github.com/israkir/cox-watermarking and https://www.princeton.edu/~cuff/ele201/labs.html

# What is necessary
This project is fully develop in Matlab and should work both in windows/mac operating systems.However it's important that:
-The Matlab version is at least R2017a as it supports the use of simulink for program all android devices.
-Install the Simulink Support Package for Android Devices: Search in matlab on the Add Ons option for it.
